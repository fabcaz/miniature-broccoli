### Goal:

To gain some familiarity with front end fundamentals.

### Description:

Main page with a navbar, a sidebar containing category nested dropdowns, and existing notes in the center.
Note creation page using \<template\>s to add new components in some note sections (submitForm() needs to called from console since the submit button was not implemented).
